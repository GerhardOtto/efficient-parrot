# Gochujang Chicken

## Ingredients

### Chicken
- 450 grams skinless boneless chicken thighs or skinless boneless chicken breast
- 1/2 onion, diced
- 50 g cornstarch
- 60 ml cooking oil
- 1 green onion, finely chopped (optional garnish)
- 1 g sesame seeds, toasted (optional garnish)

### Sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 25 g white granulated sugar (or substitute with honey or brown sugar)
- 30 ml gochujang
- 30 ml regular soy sauce
- 5 g sesame seeds, toasted
- 5 ml sesame oil, toasted
- 10 g cornstarch
- 250 ml water, cold or room temperature

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Chicken**: Dice chicken thighs into small pieces. Place chicken in a large mixing bowl. Set aside.
2. **Make Sauce**: In a small bowl, combine sauce ingredients as listed (garlic, sugar, gochujang, soy sauce, sesame seeds, sesame oil, cornstarch, water). Set aside.
3. **Coat Chicken**: Into your large bowl of diced chicken, add cornstarch. Toss until chicken is evenly coated in starch.
4. **Fry Chicken**: In a large pan on medium-high heat, heat vegetable oil or any neutral oil. Fry coated chicken until golden brown and crispy, about 5-6 minutes on each side. Remove and transfer to a wire rack or paper-towel-lined plate to drain off excess oil.
5. **Cook Onions**: On medium-high heat, fry diced onions until translucent, about 30-45 seconds.
6. **Simmer Sauce**: Pour in sauce to simmer and thicken.
7. **Combine**: Once the sauce has thickened, reduce to medium heat. Toss in fried chicken to coat evenly.
8. **Garnish & Serve**: Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds. Enjoy!
